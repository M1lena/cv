##Milena Stoeva

I am an avid skier, a foodie, and a coding newbie. As of June 2015, I have successfully completed Makers Academy, a 12-week, immersive, full-time coding bootcamp, learning best practices in TDD/BDD, Agile, and Software Design. I'm interested in working within a team to help organizations find the best solutions to their problems using technology.

Previous experience includes managing development lifecycle for custom-built B2B and B2C applications for a Fortune 10 company's markets in North America, Europe, and Australia.
